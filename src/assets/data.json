Project Proposal Develop an application that allows people to create modernized Mozart music.In this project, we will utilize the Deep Composer network. The Deep Composer Project Overview: Feature arrays for each instrument are concatenated together before hashingThis figure is an example segment of a classical string quartet songSegments are hashed to prevent as much bias as possible so that the mind of the composer can be preservedThe hash codes for each segment are stored in the previous and next segments The Deep Composer Project cont.  A collection of these two-way, hash-linked segments form a songFour positional groups (Beginning, Middle, End, Finale)Runoffs between groups creates a nice flow between groupsThe collection of all segment hash codes is the hash-spaceSegment Barrier Retrieval algorithm improves hash-space retrieval efficiency Musical Building Blocks (MBBs) We visualize the hashed segments as Musical Building Blocks that can be drawnThese MBBs are points in a 3D spaceA line drawn within this 3D space can be used to demonstrate a songEach composer will draw lines differently from each otherGiving a composer a completely different set of building blocks would theoretically allow the composer to play a different genre of music The Deep Composer Project cont. Extensive Multi-LSTM Deep Neural NetworkDesigned to recreate the minds of great composersForwards and Backwards HashingHashed-Segment Concatenation ModelProject written in Python 2 and 3Framework utilizes PyTorchOverview of network architecture demonstrated in the figure Proposal Must haves:A homepage for login and new-user registrationA database builder page option for the user to submit songs to automatically create their own music database. Users can use the system-provided music database, their own or both.A music creation page for the user to request new musicAn engine page for the team to conveniently maintain and experiment with different  music generation networksNice to haves:Application is cross-platform and available to mobile devices.Option for user to share generated songs with friends.More than one trained network loaded in server (Ex. Mozart and Chopin).Compatibility score: Compare two composers together to see how similar they are. Timeline 1.) Train a composer (Mozart) model using previous architecture2.) Gather music from a modern genre to create a new MBB hash-space using previous code3.) Test Mozart model with new MBB hash-space locally4.) Develop web application to host  the trained model and hash-spaces (original and new MBB hash-spaces)5.) Develop more models & hash-spaces for web application6.)

Think Starship.There will be a hole in the groundThe debris will go someplace as some speedSomeplace includes kilometers away, and kilometers upSome speed is many kilometers per secondThere is stuff on the ground to hitIt can be raining dust all over the moonThere is stuff in space to hit, that is moving really realy fastLike driving through a rain storm, 200 MPH, no windshield, but worseMuch WorseWe need to Know what is happening and Share what is happening! 3 Pre PELT I 4 Moon Local: Moon Area: GatewayStation Orbit PELT I 5 PELT II There are still a few needs:Particle Collision Detection and Analysis, including particle to particle and particle to surface interactions.  Can we hide behind something?Erosion Rates on landing sites.  How big is the hole?Dynamic Landings and Environmental inputs.  What does the entire landing look like?File, Archive and Runtime Optimization for the 2D system.  How do we save it?3D User Interface and integration with Shaders & Displays.  How do we communicate?The Goal is to:Dramatically increase the ability to quickly and reliably analyze Lunar launch and landing impacts across the Cislunar environment.

        "19": "  COP 4934 Initial Project Proposal\/Requirements Document  Divide and Conquer    Create one document that has a total page count limited to 15 pages and contains the following content: 1. Project descriptive title, group members, and identification of sponsor (if any) or other significant contributors. 2. Project narrative description with a statement of motivation for the project (including at least one paragraph minimum per team member that describes their personal interest\/motivation in this project), a discussion of the goals and objectives, and a discussion of the function of the project.  Be sure to state any design criteria and constraints.  Also you MUST include a separately labeled section or subsection with the title \ufb01Broader Impacts\ufb02 that describes in a minimum of 1 paragraph, the broader implications or impact of your project on society both local and global. How might your project impact underrepresented groups (within science and technology (STEM) or society as a whole), the disabled, non-profit organizations, the environment, diversity, increased participation in STEM fields or the workforce, public engagement in STEM areas, improved national security, enhanced infrastructure, or improved education are all examples. These sections are usually qualitative and avoid using \ufb01numbers\ufb02, but contain a conceptual discussion specific to the project.  Use descriptions such as \ufb01lightweight, portable, programmable, low cost, flexible, high resolution, scalable, low power, accurate, mobile, peer-to-peer, autonomic\ufb02 etc. Also you MUST include a separately labeled section or subsection with the title \ufb01Legal, Ethical, and Privacy Issues\ufb02 that describes in a minimum of 1 paragraph, any such issues that you dealt with as part of the design and implementation of your solution to the original problem and\/or that those using, maintaining, or expanding upon your solution may face going forward. 3. A list of specifications and requirements for the project as a whole as agreed to by both your team members and your project sponsor.  Use as many quantitative measures and metrics as possible.  Think about what metrics you will use to verify and evaluate your project.  Answer the questions: how many, how often, how high, how long, how complex, what values, what events occur, etc.  This section has \ufb01numbers\ufb02. It is this section that describes in detail what it means for your project to \ufb01work\ufb02. 4. A short description or listing of \ufb01ideas\ufb02 from each group member about directions to explore or potential solutions to various aspects of your project. This stems from Dr. Hoekstra\u2122s brainstorming discussion at the Sr. Design Boot Camp. 5. One or more project block diagrams and\/or figures in as much detail as possible (see below).  Include a project high-level diagram that illustrates each component and their connections\/interfaces if appropriate.  Sometimes a drawing will communicate more information about a specific implementation than just words. This is why patents use drawings as well as text as part of the legal description. 6. Project budget and financing. Remember to think about potential software licensing costs, charges from cloud-based services (e.g. AWS), mobile app development, code repositories, 2D\/3D assets, or website graphic design costs. 7. Project milestones (WITH DATES) for both semesters as best as can be determined now   2  Your initial project identification documentation should contain a detailed project block diagram.  This may consist of either a single complete block diagram or a series of nested diagrams, each level containing additional detail.  Construct separate block diagrams for project software and project hardware, if applicable.  Software diagrams should clearly indicate where the software is running (mobile, client, server, cloud), how the various pieces communicate, and what information they are communicating.  The information provided for each block in the diagram should include: 1. The name of the Group member administratively responsible for the block. 2. Block name, which should be descriptive of its function. 3. Block status: a. To be acquired \u0152 meaning the block will be purchased or donated b. Acquired \u0152 block has been donated or purchased c. Research \u0152 block design approach is being investigated d. Design \u0152 block is currently being designed e. Prototype \u0152 block is currently being prototyped f. Completed \u0152 block design is a finished prototype 4. Name each input and output associated with each block 5. Diagram Legend.  The legend should expand all acronyms and describe all named entities in the block diagram by giving brief definitions. Include any additional information that would increase the understanding of the block diagram.  The use of identifier grouping and color may be helpful.  Example: Draw all of member 1\u2122s blocks with red rectangles; draw all of member 2\u2122s blocks with blue rectangles, etc.   ",
